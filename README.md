## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Qdrant (can run locally via Docker)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevinGreenwell/MIAgent.git
cd MIAgent
```

2. Create virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up Qdrant (using Docker):
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

5. Add your OpenAI API key:
```bash
echo "your-api-key-here" > API.txt
```

6. Process and embed documents (if you have the source documents):
```bash
# Process reference documents
python process_references.py

# Embed reference documents
python embed_references.py

# CFR documents should be processed similarly
python embed_46cfr.py
```
